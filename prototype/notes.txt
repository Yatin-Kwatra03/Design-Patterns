prototype is a creational design patter also known as clone.

It helps us to copy existing objects without making our code dependent
on their classes.

The idea is to copy existing objects rather than creating a new instance from scratch.
The existing objects acts as a prototype

Prototype mainly has 3 components
1. prototype : object to be copied / cloned
2. prototype registry : places where we kept all the prototype
3. client: class which wants the clone

why ?
prototype patterns are required since object creation is expensive and time consuming so we creating
objects using the existing objects itself.
