There is an FPL league going on in our company. There are different sports competitions being organized. In any sport, a player will go in Auction.
Each player will be categorised as a Noob player / Pro player.


So build a system, which allows an employee to take part in auction for a sport with the levels (Noob / Experienced).




Abstract Factory Pattern notes:

So it is used when you need to return a family of related products. Let's say a product has multiple implementations.
but each product is compatible with only some implementations. So abstract factory will return the group of those
compatible implementations based on some parameters.

Each factory should has its own implementation for productA and productB. because those 2 will be compatible
wiht each other.

In a nutshell, abstract factory method provides interface to create families of related objects without specifying
its concrete implementation.


In our case noob player of basketball is only compatible with experienced player of basketball and not with any (noob / experienced)
player of football
